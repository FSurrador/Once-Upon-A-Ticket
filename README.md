# **Once Upon A Ticket**


### **What is "Once Upon a Ticket?"**


The platform I decided to implement is a website, which contains a **movie ticket generator** custom to each user. The main objective is sharing on social media, however I thought it would make sense to use the gallery section for full consultation of the artefacts already generated.
The site will have three sections: “Home”, which redirects to the landing page; “About”, which contextualizes the project and its functioning from the first to the last stage; ”Gallery”, which will contain all tickets generated by users who chose to save their generated result. This last section is not yet implemented, however in Stage 3 it will be part of the requested documentation.
